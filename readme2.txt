Our first NLP assignment where we, the students ourselves labelled a set of 2 events and classifying which of the two comes first.
So the test data isn't very reliable, but nonetheless we used this as our testdata and tried to get a higher accuracy as possible with our implementation of using different techniques to classify it.

Three different implementations that use 3 different techniques are uploaded.

The classification is a multiclass classification, with 3 classes/labels,
Label 0: Event order can't be decided (or either ordering works),
Label 1: Event 1 occurs before event 2; and 
Label 2: Event 2 occurs before event 1.
